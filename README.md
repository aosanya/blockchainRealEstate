# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

The capstone will builds upon the knowledge I have gained in the course in order to build a decentralized housing product.
The tasks includes

#ERC721 Mintable Contract
1) Creating an ERC721 Mintable Contract
2) Writing test cases for the mintable contract
To run tests run the following commands
`npm install`
`Truffle Test`

#Implement Zokrates
1) Using Docker to install and instantiate a Zokrates zkSnarks development environment
2) Completing the Zokrates proof in square.code by adding the variable names in square.code
3) Generating Proofs. 10 proofs were generated and can be found at ~zokrates/code/square/proof_.json
4) Writing a test script to verify the solidity contract generated by Zokrates executed successfully - eth-contracts/test/TestSquareVerifier.js
5) Writing a test contract for ZK and ERC721 integration - SolnSquareVerifier.sol

#Deploy Contract
1) Deploy SolnSquareVerifier contract to Rinkeby network
2) Mint 10 tokens
##Contract
Address : 0x8b26d4c864325ae0b315d311b6014a0aa76752f9
Etherscan Address : https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8b26d4c864325ae0b315d311b6014a0aa76752f9
ABI : ~eth-contracts/public/js/abi.js

#Opensea
1) Generate OpenSea marketplace
2) Test and Verify OpenSea with your SolnSquareVerifier tokens
3) List 5 of your tokens on the marketplace
4) Purchase those 5 tokens using a different address
##Marketplace
Storefront : https://rinkeby.opensea.io/category/simba
To participate in the Opensea marketplace, follow the link below providing the  Token Id
